Level ups are pretty simple. The game pulls 7 random numbers, starting with HP, and compares them to the character's growth rates. For each RN which is lower than the respective growth rate, the character gains that stat.

For example, say that the 7 RNs rolled are as follows:
 HP ST SK SP DF RS LK
  7 81 32 87 21 45  0

And the character's growths are as follows:
 HP ST SK SP DF RS LK
 40 35 40 50 15 45 50

The character would gain HP, Skill, and Luck.

Note the following errata:
 * The character does not gain Res, because the RN rolled has to be less than the growth rate. Equal to the growth rate doesn't count.
 * Despite its position on the stat screen, luck is rolled *last*, not between Speed and Defense

If a unit doesn't grow a single stat, the game rolls a new set of 7 RNs and uses those for the level up. If the unit *still* fails to grow a single stat, the game rolls yet another set of 7 RNs and uses those for the level up. This will only happen twice: If the third set of RNs still fails to gain any stats, the unit gets a blank level up. So on 0% growths ROMs, you will see level-ups consume 21 RNs, while on 100% ROMs, they will always consume 7 RNs. Most of the time on normal ROMs they'll also consume 7 RNs, but Jagens and such can trigger this re-rolling sometimes.

Last thing to note is that if a unit tries and fails to level a capped stat, that will still prevent the re-roll. So if a unit only rolls level-ups in capped stats, they can get a blank level while only consuming 7 (or 14) RNs.
